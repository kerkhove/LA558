<p>During spring break while studying abroad in Spain, I decided to travel 
  solo through Denmark and southern Sweden. My favorite stop on this trip
  was Aarhus, Denmark. While in Denmark's second-largest city, I visited
  an outdoor museum of real historical buildings from across Denmark dating
  back to the 17th century. The ARoS Art Museum was also a highlight, its
  circular rainbow walkway visible in the image below.</p>
