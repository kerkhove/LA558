<h1>My Mapbox Map Idea</h1>    
<p>
    If I made a map style in Mapbox I would create a map that serves to emphasize the infrastructure in place that allows us to cross water bodies. There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the condition of our bridges and tunnels and one way to make them are larger priority in the eyes of the public is simply to illustrate how common they are. 
</p> 
<p>
    The only layers present would be the basemap, bridges/tunnels, waterways, and water bodies. The bridges/tunnels layer would by a solid green and visible at zoom level 2 in order to illustrate how prevalent this type of infrastructure is across the entire United States. The waterways and water bodies layers would be a regular blue and become visible at zoom level 3.
